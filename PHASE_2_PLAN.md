# Phase 2: Core Data Infrastructure - Detailed Plan

## Current Issues Identified ❌

### Data Structure Problems
1. **Platform Mismatch**: Influencers have different platforms than their posts
   - Influencer INF_001 is on YouTube, but creates posts on YouTube, Facebook, etc.
   - Need consistent platform association

2. **Missing Columns**: Calculations expect columns that don't exist
   - `calculate_platform_metrics()` expects 'platform' in merged data
   - ROI calculations expect 'orders' but tracking data may not have it

3. **Data Relationship Issues**: 
   - Posts and tracking data not properly linked to influencers
   - Inconsistent field names across CSV files

## Phase 2 Objectives ✅

### Goal: Build Robust Data Foundation
**Timeline**: Complete data infrastructure that supports all dashboard features without errors

### Core Requirements
1. **Data Schema Standardization**
   - Consistent column names across all CSV files
   - Proper data types and validation
   - Clear relationships between entities

2. **Data Generation Fix**
   - Influencers can post on multiple platforms
   - Posts properly linked to influencer's primary platform
   - Tracking data matches post and influencer data

3. **Calculation Engine**
   - All metrics calculations work without errors
   - Proper handling of missing data
   - Consistent aggregation methods

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of malformed data
   - Clear error messages for users
   - Data validation at load time

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Data Schema (Priority: Critical)
- [ ] **Standardize influencer platform assignment**
  - Each influencer has ONE primary platform
  - Posts match influencer's platform
- [ ] **Add missing columns**
  - Ensure tracking data has 'orders' column
  - Add platform info to all necessary tables
- [ ] **Validate data relationships**
  - All posts have valid influencer_id
  - All tracking records link to existing posts/influencers

### Step 2: Fix Data Generator (Priority: Critical)
- [ ] **Platform consistency**
  - Influencer platform determines post platform
  - Remove platform mismatches
- [ ] **Complete data coverage**
  - Every influencer has posts
  - Every post has tracking data
  - Every influencer has payout data
- [ ] **Realistic data ranges**
  - Engagement rates within industry standards (1-8%)
  - Revenue amounts realistic for HealthKart scale
  - Follower counts appropriate for platforms

### Step 3: Fix Calculation Functions (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Platform metrics calculation**
  - Fix merge operations between dataframes
  - Handle missing platform data gracefully
- [ ] **ROI calculations**
  - Ensure all required columns exist
  - Add proper error handling for division by zero
- [ ] **Engagement metrics**
  - Consistent calculation methods
  - Proper handling of zero reach values

### Step 4: Data Validation Layer (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] **Schema validation**
  - Check required columns exist
  - Validate data types
  - Check for null values in critical fields
- [ ] **Business logic validation**
  - Engagement rates within reasonable ranges
  - Revenue values are positive
  - Date ranges are valid
- [ ] **Relationship validation**
  - All foreign keys exist
  - No orphaned records

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] All dashboard pages load without errors
- [ ] All calculations complete successfully
- [ ] Data uploads work with validation
- [ ] Charts and tables display correct data

### Data Quality Success
- [ ] Consistent platform data across all files
- [ ] All influencers have complete data records
- [ ] Realistic engagement and revenue metrics
- [ ] No missing or orphaned data

### User Experience Success
- [ ] Clear error messages when data issues occur
- [ ] Fast loading times for all dashboard pages
- [ ] Accurate metrics and calculations
- [ ] Intuitive data relationships

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Fixed Data Files**
   - `influencers.csv` - Clean influencer profiles with consistent platforms
   - `posts.csv` - Posts matching influencer platforms
   - `tracking_data.csv` - Complete tracking with orders and revenue
   - `payouts.csv` - Payout data for all influencers

2. **Updated Calculation Engine**
   - Fixed `calculate_platform_metrics()` function
   - Robust ROI calculation with error handling
   - Consistent engagement rate calculations

3. **Data Validation System**
   - Schema validation functions
   - Business rule validation
   - Clear error reporting

4. **Testing Verification**
   - All dashboard pages working
   - All charts displaying data
   - All filters functioning correctly
   - Export functionality working

## What We're NOT Doing in Phase 2

❌ **Advanced Features** (Save for Phase 3+)
- Machine learning insights
- Predictive analytics
- Advanced visualization types
- External API integrations

❌ **UI Enhancements** (Save for Phase 4+)
- Custom styling
- Advanced interactivity
- Mobile optimization
- User authentication

❌ **Scale Optimization** (Save for Phase 5+)
- Database integration
- Performance optimization
- Caching mechanisms
- Multi-user support

## Phase 2 Testing Plan

### Core Functionality Tests
1. **Data Generation Test**
   - Generate sample data
   - Verify all files created
   - Check data consistency

2. **Page Loading Tests**
   - Data Upload page loads
   - Campaign Performance page shows metrics
   - ROI Analysis page displays charts
   - Insights page generates recommendations
   - Export page functions

3. **Filter Tests**
   - Platform filters work
   - Category filters work
   - Combined filters work
   - Filter reset works

### Error Scenario Tests
1. **Missing Data Tests**
   - Handle empty CSV files
   - Handle missing columns
   - Handle orphaned records

2. **Invalid Data Tests**
   - Negative revenue values
   - Invalid date formats
   - Text in numeric columns

This focused approach ensures we build a solid foundation before adding advanced features.
