# Influencer Campaign ROI Dashboard

## Overview

HealthKart runs influencer campaigns across various social platforms (Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) to promote a wide range of products across multiple brands such as MuscleBlaze, HKVitals, and Gritzo. Influencers are compensated either per post or based on the number of orders they generate. The marketing team needs better visibility into campaign performance, ROI, and payout tracking.

This web application provides a centralized dashboard to simulate, track and analyze influencer campaign data. It enables internal teams to answer questions like:
- Which influencers deliver the highest ROI?
- How are campaigns performing by platform, brand, and product?
- What is the incremental lift generated by influencer activity?
- Are payouts being accurately calculated and tracked?

## Objective

Build an open‑source, web‑based dashboard that allows internal marketing teams to:
- Upload and ingest influencer and campaign performance data
- Calculate and visualize ROI and incremental ROAS
- Filter and break down metrics by brand, influencer, platform, and product
- Track influencer payouts based on post or order volume
- Generate insights to optimize future campaigns

The tool will be developed in a modular fashion, deployed via Replit, and version‑controlled in a GitHub repository.

## Requirements

1. **Data Modeling**  
   Simulate the following datasets in CSV format:
   - **influencers**: `ID`, `name`, `category`, `gender`, `follower_count`, `platform`  
   - **posts**: `influencer_id`, `platform`, `date`, `URL`, `caption`, `reach`, `likes`, `comments`  
   - **tracking_data**: `source`, `campaign`, `influencer_id`, `user_id`, `product`, `date`, `orders`, `revenue`  
   - **payouts**: `influencer_id`, `basis (post/order)`, `rate`, `orders`, `total_payout`  

2. **Features to Build**  
   - Upload or ingest influencer campaign data  
   - Track performance of posts and influencers  
   - Calculate ROI and incremental ROAS  
   - Filter by brand, product, influencer type, and platform  
   - Surface insights: top influencers, best personas, poor ROIs  
   - Optional: export data or insights to CSV/PDF  

3. **Output Expectations**  
   - Working dashboard (Streamlit, Dash, Google Sheets, etc.)  
   - README with assumptions and setup guide  
   - Insights summary (Notion page or PDF)  
   - Optional: GitHub repository

## Development Plan

The development is organized into six modules. Each module aligns with core requirements and will be built and tested incrementally to allow easy rollback and tracking.

---

### Module 1: Data Modeling & Mock Dataset Creation

**Goal:** Simulate clean, structured datasets for all required entities.

**Tasks:**
- Create mock data for:
  - `influencers`: ID, name, category, gender, follower_count, platform  
  - `posts`: influencer_id, platform, date, URL, caption, reach, likes, comments  
  - `tracking_data`: source, campaign, influencer_id, user_id, product, date, orders, revenue  
  - `payouts`: influencer_id, basis (post/order), rate, orders, total_payout  
- Ensure relational consistency between datasets  
- Document assumptions clearly in the README  

**Evaluation Criteria:** Data modeling, documentation clarity

---

### Module 2: Data Ingestion & Upload Interface

**Goal:** Build functionality to upload or ingest influencer campaign data.

**Tasks:**
- Add upload component for CSV/XLSX files (or simulate ingestion via local mock files)  
- Validate uploaded data schema  
- Store data for use across components (in-memory or lightweight store)  

**Evaluation Criteria:** Code quality, product sense

---

### Module 3: Metrics & Performance Tracking

**Goal:** Enable core analytics and influencer post tracking.

**Tasks:**
- Calculate performance metrics:
  - Engagement rate (likes, comments, reach)  
  - Revenue and order counts per influencer and per post  
- Display campaign performance by influencer, platform, brand, and product  
- Add filters (dropdowns) for platform, brand, product, influencer type  

**Evaluation Criteria:** Analytical thinking, product sense, UX

---

### Module 4: ROI & Incremental ROAS Analysis

**Goal:** Build logic for ROAS and incremental lift calculation.

**Tasks:**
- Implement formulas:
  - **ROAS** = Revenue / Cost  
  - **Incremental ROAS** = (Revenue – Baseline) / Cost  
- Visualize ROAS trends by campaign and platform  
- Identify and flag campaigns with poor ROI  

**Evaluation Criteria:** Analytical thinking, storytelling

---

### Module 5: Insights Engine

**Goal:** Surface actionable insights for the marketing team.

**Tasks:**
- Identify and display:
  - Top influencers by ROI  
  - Best-performing personas (platform × category × gender)  
  - Underperforming campaigns or influencers  
- Optional: Export insights to CSV or PDF  
- Summarize key findings in a Notion page or PDF  

**Evaluation Criteria:** Insights & storytelling, product sense

---

### Module 6: Final Dashboard, Documentation & Submission

**Goal:** Package the application for delivery.

**Tasks:**
- Polish UI/UX and finalize layout  
- Complete README with:
  - Project overview and objective  
  - Setup and run instructions  
  - Assumptions and known limitations  
- Deploy the app to Replit and push code to GitHub  
- Add links to deployed app and repository  

**Evaluation Criteria:** Code quality, documentation clarity, completeness
